<body>
    <h2>Topics:</h2>

    <p>This website is going to be my travel sites about some of
        different states I have been to during my college time</p>


    <h2>Audiences:</h2>
    <p>My audiences will be my firends, classmates, and whoever wants to know more about me and is interested in my
        travel history</p>

    <h2>Designs & Styles:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>My website design will be simple and casual. Basically I will use some elements we learnt in class like
            flex boxes,
            iframes, and interactive designs to make my websites looks cool and funny.
        </li>

        <li>Right mow I am thinking make different color schemes on different web pages which correspond to different
            places I have been to.
            The color theme may be depend on the characteristics of that place.
            
        </li>
    </ul>


    
    <p>Here are some travel blogs/websites that inspire my design:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><a target="_blank" href="https://www.saltinourhair.com/">Salt in our Hair</a></li>
        <li><a target="_blank" href="https://theplanetd.com/">The Planet</a></li>
        <li><a target="_blank" href="https://www.visitutah.com/">Visit Utah</a></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Scopes:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>I am planning to have 4-5 pages including one home page and 3-4 travel pages including pictures, a short
            travel summary and some fun memories</li>
    </ul>
