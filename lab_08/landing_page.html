        <p>Comprising the USC Trojan Marching Band, USC Song Leaders, USC Spirit Leaders, and the Trojans' mascot
            Traveler,
            The Spirit of Troy is the energetic soul of the University of Southern California, providing the Trojan
            Family
            with music, dance, cheer, and esprit de corps.
        </p>

        <p>

            The Trojan Marching Band was founded in 1880 and now features over 300 passionate students from nearly every
            major at USC. Twice named the “Best Band in College Football” by USA Today, the Trojan Marching Band has
            attended over 450 consecutive USC Football games at home or on the road. A portion of the TMB follows the
            Trojans to every game with the entire band traveling biennially to the Midwest for the Notre Dame contest.
            The
            TMB's commitment to USC Athletics is not limited to the gridiron, though. From volleyball to soccer,
            baseball to
            rowing, the band is there to root the Trojans on to victory, attending over 85 USC sports events each year.
